        <h5>Who am I?</h5>
        <p>Hi👋! This is Jindi Chai.</p>
        <h5>Where am I from?</h5>
        <p>I was born in Shenyang, China, and now I live in NYC.</p>

        <h5>What am I studing?</h5>
        <p>I am a senior student at NYU Tisch IMA and want to learn knowledge about web, media and design.</p>

        <h4 id="bg">Self Portrait</h4>
        <br>
        <h5>What is the story of your name?</h5>
        <p>My name comes from the phrase “巾帼英雄天下无敌” (a heroine unmatched in the world), and my parents chose the first and the last characters, Jin and Di, as a reminder of strength and courage.</p>
        <h5>What is a plant that represents you?</h5>
        <p>I would choose the peach blossom, because when I was a child, they always bloomed around my birthday. To me, they represent warmth, growth, and a sense of home.</p>

        <h5>What are two of your hobbies? Describe what you like about them.</h5>
        <p>One of my hobbies is traveling, which I love because it allows me to experience different places and cultures firsthand.</p>

        <img class="gallary" src="file/sea.JPG">
        <p>Another is playing video games🎮, which I enjoy because it helps me relax and also inspires my creativity through interactive storytelling.</p>
        <h5>What are you excited to learn about the world?</h5>
        <p>I'm excited to explore how I can use design, media and technology to express myself, understand the world better, and create projects that help others.</p>
        <h5>What is your favorite song?</h5>
        <p>My favorite song is “Wayfarer (山海)” by No Party For Cao Dong, because it feels emotional, powerful, and very close to my own inner thoughts.</p>

        <h5>What is your favorite food?</h5>
        <p>My favorite food is hot pot, because I love the communal aspect of sharing a meal with friends and family, and the variety of ingredients and flavors that can be enjoyed together.</p>

        <h4 id="un">Something Unexpected</h4>
        <p>Something unexpected is that I have a dog🐕 named Guiyuan (which means “longan fruit”). She's playful, and always brings joy into my daily life.</p>

        <img class="dog" src="file/dog.JPG">
        <p>Another fun fact is that I take the train every day to commute, which gives me time to observe people, think, or just enjoy some quiet moments.</p>
